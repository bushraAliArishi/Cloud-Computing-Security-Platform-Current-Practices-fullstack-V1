# ☁️ Cloud Computing Security Platform – Fullstack Version

This is a full-stack web application based on my original graduation project:  
**"Cloud Computing Security Platform – Current Practices"**

It has been rebuilt using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, reflecting the full-stack knowledge I developed during the **Tuwaiq Bootcamp**.  
The development is currently taking place directly inside **GitHub Codespaces**.

 
## 📌 Project Overview

This platform is designed to help organizations:

- Evaluate their cloud security practices.
- Document assessments securely.
- Identify risks and compliance gaps.
- Generate reports for operational improvement.
